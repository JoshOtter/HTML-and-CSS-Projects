		<h1>Why Anime is so great.</h1>
		<main>
			<h6>It is great for three reasons:</h6>
			<h3>1. The ability to convey emotions easily.</h3>
			<p>Through larger than life animation and the use of metaphorical imagery, an anime character's emotional state is quickly and accurately communicated to the viewer.</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/animes-visual-language">
				Anime and manga have a unique visual language that conveys character emotions and thoughts. 
				Many of us “regular” anime watchers are so familiar with these symbols that we don’t give them a second thought. 
				These symbols (like the vein popping out, as shown to the left) can make anime confusing for people new to anime.

			<h3>2. The ability to make amazing scenes without immersion breaking special effects.</h3>
			<p>In live action movies and shows, the visual difference between what is real and what is artificially created can break a viewers immersion. In anime everything is uniform to the style of the artist who can create seemless worlds and scenes without visual dissonance.</p>

			<h3>3. The inclusion of empathy in many characters.</h3>
			<p>Coming from non-Western cultures, anime often portrays its characters with empathy by giving them plenty of background. It also portrays them as having empathy by often giving second chances to the antagonists in the stories.</p>
