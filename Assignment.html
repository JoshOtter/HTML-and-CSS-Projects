		<h1>Why Anime is so great.</h1>
		<h6>It is great for three reasons:</h6>
		<h3>1. The ability to convey emotions easily.</h3>
		<p>Through larger than life animation and the use of metaphorical imagery, an anime character's emotional state is quickly and accurately communicated to the viewer.</p>
		<h3>2. The ability to make amazing scenes without immersion breaking special effects.</h3>
		<p>In live action movies and shows, the visual difference between what is real and what is artificially created can break a viewers immersion. In anime everything is uniform to the style of the artist who can create seemless words and scenes without visual dissonance.</p>
		<h3>3. The inclusion of empathy in many characters.</h3>
		<p>Coming from non-Western cultures, anime often portrays its characters with empathy by giving them pleanty of background. It also protrays them as having empathy by often giving second chances to the antagonists in the stories.</p>
