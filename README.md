# HTML and CSS Projects
This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.
## Projects
* [Portfolio Site](https://joshotter.github.io/)
* [Space Station Site](https://github.com/JoshOtter/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/Spacestation_Project)
* [Movie Theater Site](https://github.com/JoshOtter/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/bootstrap4_project)
* [MMO Site](https://github.com/JoshOtter/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/main/One-Page%20Website)
### Portfolio Site
This page is a customized portfolio site containing information about me and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages. It is styled with CSS and contains a navbar with animation effects, a background video, three rows of two columns with containers for images and text. It utilizes a form with inputs set to be emailed to my personal email address.
### Space Station Site
This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled with CSS, and it features a navbar fixed to the top of the page, an image gallery, and a form.
### Movie Theater Site
This page was a project where I was given an image of what the "Showtimes" section was supposed to look like and was asked to use Bootstrap4 to get the webpage to match.
### MMO Site
This page is an ongoing project I made for an assignment to make a one page website. It contains sections pertaining to MMOs that follow certain payment models with images and trailers for each game, and it features a form at the end that will eventually give MMO recommendations based on radio button input.
